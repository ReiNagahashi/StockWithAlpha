I developed a stock trading API using Go language. 

In this project, I implemented a feature that visually displays the price movement trends of selected stocks on the front end by integrating it with Google Charts.
Additionally, the API provides various features for fundamental and technical analysis. (You can view the implementation of each feature in the commit history on GitHub.)
